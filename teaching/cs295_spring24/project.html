    <h2 class="tophead">Course Project</h2>

    <p>
      Throughout the course, students will work individually or in small groups (up to 3 students) to conduct a research project on an interesting security and privacy-related problem. The project will be evaluated according to the group size. Please form your groups by <strong>Monday, April 15</strong> and add your group in the <strong><a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/62960/modules/items/2668243">sign-up sheet in Canvas</a></strong>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Students will have the option to choose from a list of potential project topics or propose their own research idea after discussion with the instructor. Typical projects include analyzing the security or privacy of a system on any of the platforms discussed in class, developing new solutions for limitations of existing security and privacy systems, re-implementing or adapting an existing attack or defense, or conducting an in-depth survey on a topic of interest that has not been surveyed before. The students are encouraged to think about ideas that link the projects to their own research. All students/groups are required to schedule office hours with the instructor to discuss and finalize their project topic before Week 4.
    </p>

    <h3 class="resp">Project Proposal Presentation</h3>

  		Each group will deliver an in-class 10-minute presentation with a 5-minute Q&A  session. A 
  		representative of each group will talk about their proposed project and 
  		get feedback from the class. In the presentation, please focus on answering the following questions:<br>

  		<ol class="outline">
  			<li><strong>Problem</strong> - why is it important and relevant?</li>
  			<li><strong>Related work</strong> – what has been done before to address this problem, and what gaps remain?</li>
  			<li><strong>Approach and methodology</strong> – what will you do to address the gap, and why do you think it will work?</li>
            <li><strong>Results</strong> – what do you expect to achieve in the project?</li>
  		</ol>

  <h3 class="resp">Project Proposal</h3>

  		<span>Please write a 4-page proposal for the course project to detail the following:</span>
  		<ul>
