    <h3 class="resp">Reading Summaries</h3>

    <p>For each class, you are expected to write a one-page summary of the assigned readings/papers. In your summary, please focus on answering the following questions:<br>
    </p>
    <ol class="outline">
      <li>What is the problem that the paper is focusing on?</li>
      <li>What are the key insights and main contributions of the proposed work, and how do they address prior works' limitations?</li>
      <li>What are some weaknesses or limitations of the paper?</li>
      <li>Do you have any suggested improvements for the paper or any related ideas?<br></li>
    </ol>
    <p>These readings summaries should demonstrate that you have <b>read the paper</b> and <b>thought carefully</b> about the topic.</p>
    <p>The summaries will be due at 11:59 pm PDT before each class via <strong><a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/62960/assignments">Canvas Assignments</a></strong>.</p>


    <h3>Discussion Lead</h3>

    <p>Depending on the number of students enrolled, each student is expected to present and lead the discussion for the assigned readings in one or two sessions. Please take a look at the assigned papers for each session. If you are interested in leading the discussion in any of the sessions, please share your top two preferences <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/62960/modules/items/2655265">here</a>. The deadline for sharing your preferences for sessions to act as discussion leads is <strong>April 5, 2024</strong>. After April 5, the instructor will assign the students as discussion leads for each session.</p>

    <p>As a discussion lead, you will be responsible for the following: 1) Deliver a 25-minute presentation of the paper assigned for the class. 2) In addition to the assigned reading for the class, find two papers published in top-tier conferences that you think are relevant to the assigned paper and prepare a 15-minute presentation on these papers, including a comparative analysis of these papers with the assigned paper. 3) Read and understand the technical details of the paper and create a list of <strong>discussion prompts</strong>. The discussion prompts should engage students in critical and creative thinking about the paper and the broader topic.</p>

    <p>Please share your presentations and the discussion prompts with the instructor before the class through email with [CS295] tag in the email subject. Please allow two days to receive any feedback. This will be a good opportunity for you to learn to discuss ideas around a research topic and find related works, and it will help your presentation and communication skills as well.</p>
