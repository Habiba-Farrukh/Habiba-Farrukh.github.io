    <h2>Course Description</h2>

    <p>Computing platforms are constantly evolving to meet the diverse needs of users and enable automation in several aspects of daily life. While these emerging platforms enable several useful applications, they are also an attractive target for adversaries. In this course, we will focus on essential and contemporary research in the security and privacy of these platforms. The course will investigate the core challenges in the security and privacy of computer systems that consistently resurface in various guises across multiple platforms. Topics will include the security and privacy of mobile systems, the Internet of Things, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and autonomous and machine learning systems. Students will work on research projects and gain hands-on experience evaluating and designing secure systems.</p>

    <p>Although there are no hard requirements, the course is most suitable for students who have some programming background (e.g., an undergraduate computer programming course).</p>

    <h2>Tentative Topic List<br>
    </h2>

    <p>The tentative list of topics that will be discussed in the class are given below. See the <a href="readings.html">schedule and reading list</a> for additional details. Please
      get in touch with the instructor if you have any questions or suggestions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Mobile and IoT security and privacy</li>
      <li> XR security and privacy</li>
      <li> Multi-platform security and privacy threats</li>
      <li> Authentication and access control</li>
      <li> Sensor-based threats</li>
      <li> Generative AI-based threats and solutions</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Grading</h2>

    There will be no exams.  Instead, the grade will be based on the following:

    <p>
      <b><a href="readings.html" target="_top">Reading Summaries </a>(10%)</b> – For each class, students are be expected to read the assigned paper and write a one-page summary of the paper. The summaries will be due at 11:59 pm PST before each class via Canvas Assignments. Please find out more details <a href="readings.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Active class participation (10)</b> - All students are expected to fully participate in all class activities to gain the most benefits from the class. Students should come to class prepared to discuss any assigned readings and provide their perspectives on these readings. Students are also expected to participate in group discussions and other in-class activities. The effectiveness of the course depends on the quality of student participation, willingness to internalize the skills and concepts covered in the course, and efforts to apply them to real-world settings.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Homeworks </b><b>(10%)</b> – There will be a few written homeworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="readings.html" target="_top"><b>Paper presentation and discussion lead </b></a><b>(20%)</b> – Depending on the number of students enrolled, each student is expected to sign up to lead the discussion for the assigned readings in one or two sessions. The discussion lead in a session will not be expected to submit the reading summaries for that session. Please find out more details about discussion lead's tasks <a href="readings.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b><a target="_top" href="project.html">Research Project </a>(50%)</b> – Throughout the course, students will work individually or in small groups (up to 3 students) to conduct a research project. The project will be evaluated according to the group size. Students will have the option to choose from a list of potential project topics or propose their own research idea after discussion with the instructor. At the end of the course, students will write a research report on the project (publishable in a security and privacy workshop/conference) and present their progress to the class. Students are encouraged to submit their research as a full paper or a poster to a security and privacy (e.g., IEEE S\&P, USENIX) venue. Submitting a full paper to these venues requires additional work beyond the quarter. The instructor will mentor students interested in continuing their research projects and submitting them to the appropriate venues. Please find out more details about project guidelines and deliverables<a href="project.html">here</a>.
