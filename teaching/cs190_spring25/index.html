    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

    <p>Learning, research, and scholarship depend upon an environment of academic integrity and honesty. This environment can be maintained only when all participants recognize the importance of upholding the highest ethical standards. All student work, including quizzes, exams, reports, and papers, must be the work of the individual receiving credit. Academic dishonesty includes, for example, cheating on examinations or any assignment, plagiarism of any kind (including improper citation of sources), having someone else take an examination or complete an assignment for you (or doing this for someone else), or any activity in which you represent someone else’s work as your own. Violations of academic integrity will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct. The impact on your grade will be determined by the individual instructor’s policies. Please familiarize yourself with <a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/policies/academic-integrity/index.php">UCI’s Academic Integrity Policy</a> and speak to the instructor if you have any questions about what is and is not allowed in this course.</p>

    <br style="clear: both;">
    
    <h3>Ethics Statement</h3>

    <p>This course considers topics involving personal and public privacy and security. As part of this class, we will cover technologies whose abuse may infringe on the rights of others. As an instructor, I rely on the ethical use of these technologies. Unethical use may include circumvention of existing security or privacy measurements for any purpose or the dissemination, promotion, or exploitation of vulnerabilities of these services. Exceptions to these guidelines may occur in the process of reporting vulnerabilities through public and authoritative channels. Any activity outside the letter and spirit of these guidelines will be reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from the class and expulsion from the university.</p> 
    
    <p>When in doubt, please contact the instructor for advice. Do not undertake any action that could be perceived as technology misuse anywhere and/or under any circumstances unless you have received explicit permission from the instructor.</p>
